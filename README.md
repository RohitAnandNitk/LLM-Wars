## 🧠 LLM Wars – Multiplayer AI Guessing Game

**LLM Wars** is a real-time multiplayer web game where players give text clues to help an AI guess a hidden company based on its logo. All players in a room are shown the same logo. They take turns entering creative clues, and the selected AI model (OpenAI, Groq, or Gemini) tries to guess the company name.

The first player whose clue leads to a correct guess ends the game for **everyone in the room**, declaring them the winner!
